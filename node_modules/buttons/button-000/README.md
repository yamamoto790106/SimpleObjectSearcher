### index.hbs

* All demo markup for the component is constrained to a single page.
* [layout](), `default.hbs`, is used to "wrap" the demo page with a common head and footer. This layout is defined in the Gruntfile, in Assemble's task-level options.
* Each `button` "modifier" is listed in full, versus externalizing the modifiers into "includes" or partial views.
* Extraneous information about the demo is also embedded in the HTML with the component examples.
